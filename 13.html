            <h3>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and
                efficiency:</h3>
            <p>Visual Studio Code has been a fantastic piece of software supporting many forms of code and actively
                assisting you avoiding and flaws or hiccups in your code and from what Iâ€™ve experienced there isn't any
                flaws other than its finicky to set up and get into, google documents/ word have been quite helpful with
                getting mockups and finalized piece of written work down the only flaw is that it doesn't translate into
                code very well, trello while i think is excellent for group work but not so much in a solo project has
                assisted with me keeping track of everything I need to do and slack while an overload of information in
                the beginning has been a useful tool for keeping in touch with my tutors.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency:</h3>
            <p>A team could improve productivity in a lot of ways such as coding, designing, asset collection and
                written up work all being improved by multiple people, another way of improve production or efficiency
                would be using programs that work with each other unlike word and Visual Studio Code if a website or
                program took the basics of word and for a final copy able to convert everything written into coded
                language would be a small but time saving improvement and one more example would be my knowledge of
                coding is brand new so while im learning the basics im always questioning if there was a simpler way of
                doing what I intend to do and I feel like this will improve with time as I learn more about coding</p>

            <h3>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects:</h3>
            <p>Improvement id make on my own use of equipment and software would be to develop the HTML first since it
                help me structure how I was gonna show off my work another would be gaining more knowledge of how to
                code as it would allow me to use shortcuts to assist with time efficiency and something i need to start
                doing is asking for help when i'm struggling which would save a lot of time of me testing and scraping
                code.</p>
        </div>

        <div>
            <h3>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions:</h3>
            <p>Well to start off would be making sure as many different browser are supported and working as intended
                and the next step to that would be checking if my website works properly on different devices and their
                browser and if all that works next would be checking if the user experience works such as if your
                website has a login function and test if the resetting a password doesn't cause any errors.</p>

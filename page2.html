        <h3>1.1 Purpose of IT in modern business:</h3>
        <p>IT, and IT workers are the white blood cells of the modern business industry, They keep everything up and running, so everything can run smoothly. For example, a database of anything has never been easier to manage or update, with the capability of automated systems and programs that will adjust the database accordingly, without the need of any human assistance, except for hardware maintenance. Another advantage of having a strong IT team, automation from code, cuts out human error and allows for increased accuracy and time efficiency.</p>

        <h3>1.2 Methods, Skills and resources needed to complete a digital projects successfully:</h3>
        <p>For a digital project to be successful, the first step is to have a coordinated team plan. This sets up the metaphorical building blocks of the project and organises your team, but also the code of a system. Giving each member of the team a role, figuring out how to tie those bits of code together, and managing team productivity are all important steps that having a good plan at the start helps to accomplish efficiently. Everyone's code is a little different, as are their skills and methods. Being able to understand and integrate all the differing skills and methods into your final project is incredibly important for everything to run smoothly. Being flexible, insightful and adaptive are integral traits to have for any successful project. Finally the tools used also make a huge impact on the workflow. Having a solid coding language that is very flexible allows for any new systems, or database to be implemented, which not only allows the team to have an easier time, but also allows for the coding to be effective and efficient. My example of all listed above would be using online tools like Trello to keep track of what's done, and what needs to be done. A flow chart can be made using many programs/Websites such as: "https://app.diagrams.net/ " And for coding many engines and programming languages such as Python, exist for different purposes and that would depend on what the end goal is.</p>

        <h3>1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT:</h3>
        <p>For my website i've started off getting all the written work down which you will see going through the website and after i'm done with it i will proceed on making the frame of my website making sure to get all information and hyperlinks working for an example would be the navigation bar and after that I will be using CSS to spruce up the webpage and give it the style i want and i will be documenting all of this using <a href="https://trello.com/b/Z1WNmu3c/assignment" target="_blank">Trello</a>.</p>

        <h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects:</h3>
        <p>Some risks that a team could encounter is poor management of group and assigning them there roles which would lead to a lack of order which could also lead into poor time management which is another problem a team could run into not spending enough time on the project to finish it and another problem could be spending too much time on a certain part of the project and a conflict in coding style could be the cause of this since with everyone coding being a little different some member might not be able to integrate their code as effectively as they would with someone else's</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software:</h3>
        <p>For the software I've selected which is Visual Studio Code to write down the code for the website as it supports HTML, CSS and Javascript file types that also assist with any faulty code by marking where it doesn't work....</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes:</h3>
        <p>My chosen technologies have assisted my progress with this project greatly because with the use of Trello ive been able to keep track of what i've done and what still needs to be done, Slack and Zoom has allowed me to keep in touch with my tutors and ask for help/information during this time of quarantine from the covid-19 virus and finally Github...</p>

        <h3>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects:</h3>
        <p>The GDPR exists to allow the consumer to have more control over their information which could affect the speed of any project that requires said information dependent on how compliant the consumer is and will force companies to be a lot more open with their use of information and restrict the misuse of said information.
            While that generalizes Article 15 it also ensure the each consumer has the 8 fundamental rights of the GDPR which are:
            
            
            1: The right of access:<br>
            This allows for the “individuals the right to request a copy of any of their personal data which are being ‘processed’”.<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-access-information" target="_blank">[1]</a>
            <br><br>
            2: The right to be informed:<br>
            This give the consumer the ability to see how their data will be “collected, used, consulted or otherwise processed, and to what extent the personal data are, or will be, processed”<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-be-informed-transparency-article-13-14-gdpr" target="_blank">[2]</a> and will force the company holding the information to be “lawful, fair, and transparent”.<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-be-informed-transparency-article-13-14-gdpr" target="_blank">[2]</a>
            <br><br>
            3: The right to rectification:<br>
            This allows the consumer to change any information they believe to be inaccurate therefore allowing the consumers the “right to have the data rectified”.<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-rectification" target="_blank">[3]</a>
            <br><br>
            4: The right to erasure:<br>
            This can also be referred as the “right to be forgotten”<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-erasure-articles-17-19-gdpr" target="_blank">[4]</a> but this gives the consumer the ability and the “right to have your data erased”.<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-erasure-articles-17-19-gdpr" target="_blank">[4]</a>
            <br><br>
            5: The right to data portability:<br>
            This right helps both company and consumer with easing the flow of information while complying with the GDPR this gives the consumer the ability to “obtain your personal data from a data controller in a format that makes it easier to reuse your information”<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-data-portability-article-20-gdpr" target="_blank">[5]</a> under the right circumstances.
            <br><br>
            6: Your rights in relation to automated decision making, including profiling:<br>
            This will force a company to ask whether the consumer would or would not like to have to be a “subject to a decision based solely on automated processing”<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/your-rights-relation-automated-decision-making-including-profiling" target="_blank">[6]</a>
            <br><br>
            7: The right to object to processing of personal data:<br>
            This will allow the consumer the “right to object to certain types of processing of your personal data where this processing is carried out in connection with tasks: <ul>
            <li>in the public interest,</li>
            <li>under official authority, </li>
            <li>or in the legitimate interests of others".<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-object-processing-personal-data-article-21-gdpr" target="_blank">[7]</a></li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            8: The right of restriction:<br>
            While this is limited the consumer does have a “right of restriction of processing of your personal data by a data controller”<a href="https://www.dataprotection.ie/en/individuals/know-your-rights/right-restriction-article-18-gdpr" target="_blank">[8]</a> and this will allow a company to store the consumer information but will prevent them from most processing actions for example deletion, unless they have your permission.
            <br>
            If a company were not to comply with GDPR they will be fined up to “17 million euros, or 4% of a company’s annual turnover.”<a href="https://www.core.co.uk/blog/blog/ramifications-failing-comply-with-gdpr" target="_blank">[9]</a> while that would be legal ramification their is also a social ramification of losing trust of your consumers.</p>

    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed:</h3>
        <p>Starting off, I needed to make use of trello more, in order to track my progress more accurately. Next was to sort out the HTML in order to give me an idea of the layout I needed to use, which allowed me to formulate how my writing and code will coexist in Visual Studio Code.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate:</h3>
        <p>Visual studio code has been excellent tool for coding a website as it has assistance tools when you need it and separates code functions which helps immensely for reading code, Trello while a massively helpful tool I don't find it too effective on a single person project and finally slack and zoom have been able to keep me in contact with my tutors which are able to assist whenever they have time.</p>

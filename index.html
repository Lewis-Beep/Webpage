        <p class="coucou">My name is lewis Iâ€™m 21 years old and i've never really know what I wanted to do but I have
            massive interest in computer and anything to do with them which means I wanted to try coding for a while and
            had no idea on where to start and code nation
            has been a massive help because of that and my experience of code nation has been a really pleasent one,
            Being thrust into code was a bit overwhelming but I've been able to keep up.
            <br> My Hobby is playing video games with my friends recording them and editing them for my own amusement
            which is also a reason I want to get into coding since I love the idea of creating dumb to professional
            jokes to my friends and while
            I only have an entry level knowledge of all these subjects they are still what I enjoy doing and that why I
            wanna do and learn more about them

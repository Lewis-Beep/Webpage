        <p>My name is lewis Iâ€™m 21 years old and i've never really know what I wanted to do but I have massive interest
            in computer and anything to do with them which means I wanted to try coding for a while and had no idea on
            where to start and code nation has been a massive help because of that and my experience of code nation has
            been a good one <!-- Work in progress -->

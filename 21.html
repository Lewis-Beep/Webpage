            <h3>1.1 Describing the content and layout for each page:</h3>
            <p>My first page is my about me section and this page other than being to hub to the other pages allows me
                to mess around with it code wise and see what works and what does not while my other pages are quite
                static as their purpose is to display my written work in a orderly fashion.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
            <p>Copyright changes from country to country but the general rule for copyright is if you've marked it and
                you created it and someone uses it and/or claims it as their own work they can get in trouble with that
                country's copyright law, which forces companies to either contract someone for hired work or credit the
                maker. Other such constraints are dependent on what is legal in that country such as super injunctions
                in english law.</p>

            <h3>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account</h3>
            <p>Many users with disabilities with be severely inhibited accessing web pages and using them though there
                are programs that can assist them such as blind people can get a program that recognizes different types
                of text and is read out loud give the user at least some control over their issue, another one of these
                issue could deafness which can easily be solved with a speech to text/subtitles program but many
                disabilities don't need to be physical many of them being mental such as struggling to read certain
                fonts but other fonts being clear as day for them.</p>

            <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
            <p>There are many file types that are supported by HTML but the main ones that make a webpage run are:
                <br>
                HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language is the framework for any webpage while looking blank without the other
                files it needs in order for CSS and Javascript to be utilized fully.
                <br>
                Javascript: Javascript allows websites to run more than just simple processes allowing the website to
                make automated processes when a select part of the website is used.
                <br>
                CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is mainly used for allowing the website to look the way a creator wants it
                to be such as changing fonts, color and size</p>

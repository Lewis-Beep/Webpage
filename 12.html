            <h3>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed:</h3>
            <p class="coucou">Starting off, I needed to make use of trello more, in order to track my progress more
                accurately. Next was to sort out the HTML in order to give me an idea of the layout I needed to use,
                which allowed me to formulate how my writing and code
                will coexist in Visual Studio Code.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="halp">
            <h3>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate:</h3>
            <p class="coucou">Visual studio code has been excellent tool for coding a website as it has assistance tools
                when you need it and separates code functions which helps immensely for reading code, Trello while a
                massively helpful tool I don't find it too effective
                on a single person project and finally slack and zoom have been able to keep me in contact with my
                tutors which are able to assist whenever they have time.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project:</h3>
            <p class="coucou">While i am happy about my website if i had the time there would be alot of minor or one
                major improvement since i believe if i was given enough time to research and develop on my skills i
                could make a website im happy with, one such changes
                would be making the navigation bar alot flashier and have the website look like it has much more order
                to it.</p>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div class="halp">
            <h3>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project:</h3>
            <p class="coucou">Improvements I could make to the website are making the website with an idea in mind
                giving a lot more of a direction and therefore ordering it, redoing the code with more information on
                what i'm doing so i could make something that looks
                orderly and make use of audio files and gifs.</p>

        <div class="halp">
            <h3>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose:</h3>
            <p class="coucou">I made sure my page is error free by continually testing my page and also tested it on
                multiple browsers. I've also had trouble with css and resorted with putting css code in the html but
                after sorting that out the code has been made much clearer after fixing the css problem. One more
                outcome I struggled with was certain techniques and had to do a lot of research to learn effective
                methods such as the class function allowing me to edit a large amount of text with ease. I've made sure
                all the correct outcome information is placed correctly and organized.</p>

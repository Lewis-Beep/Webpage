        <h3>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h3>
        <p>Copyright changes from country to country but the general rule for copyright is if you've marked it and you created it and someone uses it and/or claims it as their own work they can get in trouble with that country's copyright law, which forces companies to either contract someone for hired work or credit the maker. Other such constraints are dependent on what is legal in that country such as super injunctions in english law.</p>

        <h3>1.7 Describe which are the appropriate filetypes for websites</h3>
        <p>There are many file types that are supported by HTML but the main ones that make a webpage run are: 
            <br>
            HTML: Hyper Text Markup Language is the framework for any webpage while looking blank without the other files it needs in order for CSS and Javascript to be utilized fully.
            <br>
            Javascript: Javascript allows websites to run more than just simple processes allowing the website to make automated processes when a select part of the website is used.
            <br>
            CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is mainly used for allowing the website to look the way a creator wants it to be such as changing fonts, color and size</p>
